## Select Product Variant Option

### Upload your color images

For the color options you have, you can either let the smartness of the script provide a color for you, or you can upload an image that represents that color.

_ The way I have gotten my images from my products in my demo shop was to open up each product image on my storefront in the “colorbox” \(lightbox\) and grab around ~ 40 by 40 pixels section of the product image, then save that small screen grab to my desktop, and rename the image.  
_

> There's an important naming convention to respect here! The image must be named after the color option, but be handleized, and have a .png extension.

For example, if you have a color called 'Déjà Vu Blue', then name your image deja-vu-blue.png

Other example, if your color is 'Blue/Gray', then name your image blue-gray.png.

1. Most simple example, if your color is 'Black', the name your image black.png.

3. Find the theme you want to edit, and then click **Actions &gt; Edit code.**
