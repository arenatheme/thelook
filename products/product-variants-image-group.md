We use **Image Alt text** to group images with the same alt text attribute and match with the variant color of the product.

Suppose you have a product which has 4 colors, each color has multiple images like this demo: https://arena-thelook.myshopify.com/collections/denim-shorts/products/lexiing-product-sample
