### Before you customize your theme

Before you customize your theme, it's a good idea to do the following tasks:

* [Duplicate your theme](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes/managing-themes/duplicating-themes)  
  to create a backup copy. This makes it easy to discard your changes and start again if you need to.

### Change page to customize sections

From your Shopify admin, go to **Online Store &gt; Themes**

* Find the theme that you want to edit and click **Customize**

Different types of pages have different theme sections. When you first open the theme editor, the settings for the home page are shown.

* To access the settings, **select the page type from the top bar drop-down menu:i        **![](/assets/settings.png)

The **theme editor toolbar** is divided into **Sections **and T**heme settings**.  
Next, let's explore how to configure our theme with built-in **Sections** and **Theme settings**

\(_New to Shopify? Please refer to _[_this_](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes/change-the-layout/theme-settings/sections-and-settings)_ to get knowledge of what **Sections **and **Theme settings** are_\)

### Sections

Sections are customizable blocks of content that determine the layout of your online store. Each theme includes static sections and dynamic sections.

#### Static sections

Static sections are always in specific locations on your online store. You can [edit static sections](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes/change-the-layout/theme-settings/sections-and-settings#edit-static-sections), but you can't rearrange or remove them. Each type of page on your online store includes different static sections.

#### Dynamic sections {#dynamic-sections}

You can [add](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes/change-the-layout/theme-settings/sections-and-settings#add-dynamic-sections), [rearrange](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes/change-the-layout/theme-settings/sections-and-settings#rearrange-dynamic-sections), and [remove](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes/change-the-layout/theme-settings/sections-and-settings#remove-dynamic-sections) dynamic sections to customize the layout of your home page. Each theme has a unique set of dynamic sections to choose from.

**Shopify Dynamic sections now only support for Homepages. The theme now support multi dynamic sections:
