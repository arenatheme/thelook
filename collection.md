You can group your products into collections to make it easier for customers to find them by category. Here are a few examples of collections that you might create:

* clothes for men, women, or children
* items of a certain type, such as lamps, cushions, or rugs
* items on sale
* items in a certain size or color
* seasonal products, such as holiday cards and decorations

After you create a collection, it can be shown on your online store as a webpage with a gallery of the products that are in the collection. Your customers can then click a product image on the collection page to visit a specific product's page. You can help customers find and view collections by [adding links](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/collections/make-collections-findable) to the collections in a menu in your store's navigation.

The exact layout and appearance of collection pages depends on your theme.
